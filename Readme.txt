Movie Database Management

This program is connected to a database that has a table called movies. Some columns on that table are
id, title, year, duration for movies. This program has different methods for adding a movie to that table,
printing movies released in a specified year, printing a random list of movies of a specified amount and to
delete a movie. 

The program can be run by using command prompt and running the jar file. Or an IDE can be used and the 
AppDriver.java file can be run.
